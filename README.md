## My process

I started with making a class for the outer box, sizing it, centering it, rounding the borders, then did the same for the inner box. I couldn't find a font like the design had that has the lowercase i with a dot and the lowercase t without the tail.

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- CSS custom properties
- Firefox


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
