## My process

I started with making a class for the outer box, sizing it, centering it, rounding the borders, then did the same for the inner box. I couldn't find a font like the design had that has the lowercase i with a dot and the lowercase t without the tail.

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- CSS custom properties
- Firefox


### What I learned

I learned how to apply what I've been studying with the Mozilla CSS guide. And I learned a how to set up a GitHug Pages site.
